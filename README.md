# Attack of the Coronavirus
#### First partner hackathon project! This is a classic shooter-style game where you can shoot coronaviruses with hand santizers drops. Get the highest score by shooting as many coronaviruses as you can! Unfortunately, the Github page where the game was hosted is not currently working, but you can see this [video](https://youtu.be/cM23URXHupY) for a short demo.
